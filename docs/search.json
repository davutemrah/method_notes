ErvinIn presence heteroscedasticity, ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates unbiased, usual tests significance generally inappropriate use can lead incorrect inferences. Tests based heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix (HCCM), however, consistent even presence heteroscedasticity unknown form. applications use HCCM appear rely asymptotic version known HC0.
